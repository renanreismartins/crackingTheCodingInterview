Repo for the exercises of the book http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/

I wanted to know what is required to join companies like amazon or google, so I created this repo for a draft of the exercises.

My first goal is just to SOLVE every exercise, tho not in an optimal manner. There are some unit tests but not an exhaustive coverage, I do not cover each corner case since it can be explained during interviews. Most of the exercises are in scala just for the sake of a more concise syntax, however some are in java since the book introduce it in java.
